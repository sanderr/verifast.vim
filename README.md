# verifast.vim
This adds very simple syntax highlighting to C and/or Java files for use with verifast.
The verifast.vim file recognizes verifast lines (//@ ...) and blocks (/*@ ... @*/) and highlights them differently than
the default comment highlighting.

## How to use
copy and rename the verifast.vim file to `~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim` and/or `~/.vim/after/syntax/java.vim`
